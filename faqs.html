        <p><strong>Q: How often should I see the dentist for a checkup and cleaning?</strong><br />
A: Most children and adults should see their dentist for regular cleanings and check up every six months. Regular checkups will keep your gums and teeth healthy as well as detect early problems such as gum disease, oral cancer and cavities. The best way to maintain good oral health is to visit the dentist on a regular basis.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: Which toothbrush is really better - manual or electric?</strong><br />
A: With all of the bells and whistles and hundreds of toothbrushes on the market, you've got to wonder, which is really the best - manual or electric. Our office recommends an ultra-sound toothbrush or at least a spin-brush. The models that have build in timers ensure that you will brush for a full two minutes.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: Is one toothpaste better than others? </strong><br />
A: Generally, no. However, it's advisable to use a fluoride containing toothpaste to decrease the incidence of dental decay. We recommend our patients use what tastes good to them as long as it contains fluoride. </p>

 <p><strong>Q: How often should I floss? </strong><br />
A: Flossing of the teeth once per day helps to prevent cavities from forming between the teeth where your toothbrush can't reach. Flossing also helps to keep your gums healthy.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is tooth decay?</strong><br />
A: Decay occurs when plaque the sticky substance that forms on teeth, combines with the sugars and starches of the food we eat. This combination produces acids that attack tooth enamel. The best way to prevent tooth decay is to brush and floss twice a day.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is a dental implant?</strong><br />
A: Dental implants are tiny screws that are placed in your gums, designed to act as the root of the tooth. These "roots" are used to permanently attach a single crown, a dental bridge or dentures to replace missing teeth.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is conscious sedation?</strong><br />
A: Conscious sedation makes or dental experience relaxing because you are virtually unaware of the treatment. You will have full control of bodily functions and reflexes. You can respond and communicate if the need arises, without anxiety.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is nitrous oxide?</strong><br />
A: Nitrous Oxide produces a calming effect and a sense of well being while helping you relax during dental procedures. Unlike other sedation you will have a clear head within minutes after coming off the nitrous oxide allowing you to function normally with no lingering effects. Nitrous oxide is also known as laughing has. Nitrous oxide is very safe because it is easy to take and mild. It is not addictive.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is a root canal?</strong><br />

A: An abscess of a tooth is an infection. A symptom of an abscess is pus and swelling of the soft gum tissue surrounding the tooth. An abscess can develop from tooth decay where bacteria can get invade and infect the pulp of the tooth. Trauma to a tooth can also cause an abscess. If you suspect that you have an abscess contact our office right away.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is TMJ?</strong><br />
A: The temporomandibular joint, also known as TMJ, is the ball and socket that connects the lower jaw to the bone on each side of the head. The tempormandibular joiont is stabilized by muscles that make it possible to open and close the mouth. The pain, discomfort or tenderness in or around these joints is referred to as TMJ disorders.</p>

 <p><strong>Q: What is an NTI?</strong><br />
